/**
 ~ Java Bean ~

     * A Java Bean is a simple Java class that adheres to certain conventions:
     * It must have a no-argument constructor.
     * It should have private fields (properties).
     * It should provide public getter and setter methods for accessing the properties.
     * It should implement Serializable (optional, but common in JavaBeans).
